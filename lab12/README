This project demonstrates the use of Python for importing, reading, and manipulating security log files. By processing and preparing log data, security analysts can efficiently extract meaningful insights for cybersecurity incident management.

Key Features
File Importation: Open and read a security log file (login.txt) containing user login activities.
Data Parsing: Split log data into manageable lines for further analysis.
Data Appending: Add missing entries to the log file to ensure completeness.
Restricted Access Management: Generate an allow_list.txt file containing a list of IP addresses allowed access to restricted resources.
Project Workflow
Import Security Log:

Read the contents of the login.txt file using Python's open() function and .read() method.
Store the log data as a string for processing.
Parse the Log File:

Use the .splitlines() method to convert the log file contents into a list of lines for better readability and manipulation.
Handle Missing Data:

Append a missing entry to the log file using the .write() method with append mode ("a").
Generate an Allow List:

Create a text file named allow_list.txt to store IP addresses that are authorized to access restricted information.
Write the IP addresses as a space-separated string to the file.
Verify Outputs:

Read the updated files and display their contents to confirm successful operations.
Findings
This project showcases how Python can be used to efficiently manage and process security log data. Key findings include:

Successfully preparing a complete and accurate log file by appending missing entries.
Creating an allow list of IP addresses to facilitate access control for restricted resources.
Demonstrating the importance of file handling and string manipulation in cybersecurity workflows.
How to Use
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Place your security log file (login.txt) in the same directory as the script.
Run the Python script to:
Read and parse the security log.
Add missing entries.
Generate an allow list file (allow_list.txt).
Tools and Technologies
Python: Core programming language used for file handling and string manipulation.
Text Files: login.txt and allow_list.txt serve as data sources and outputs.
Future Enhancements
Automate parsing multiple log files.
Add error handling for invalid or missing data.
Develop visualization tools for log analysis results.
