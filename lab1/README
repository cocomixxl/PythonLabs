# Practice Writing Python Code

## Overview

This lab focuses on foundational Python programming skills relevant for cybersecurity analysts. By working through this activity, participants become familiar with writing and running Python code in a notebook environment, commenting code effectively, and using the `print()` function to display information.

## Objectives

The key goals of this lab are:
- To familiarize users with Python's notebook-based coding environments.
- To demonstrate how to write, execute, and document Python code using comments.
- To practice writing and running `print()` statements to display messages.

## Key Tasks and Learnings

1. **Introduction to Markdown and Notebook Environments**  
   - Learned how to use markdown cells for documentation.
   - Practiced editing and formatting markdown cells.

2. **Executing Python Code**  
   - Ran code cells containing Python comments and code.
   - Observed outputs and understood the role of the `print()` function.

3. **Writing Python Comments**  
   - Documented the purpose of code using comments.
   - Learned that comments in Python start with a hash symbol (`#`) and are not executed.

4. **Using `print()` for Output**  
   - Practiced writing `print()` statements to display strings.
   - Combined multiple `print()` statements in a single code cell to produce sequential output.

5. **Combining Learned Concepts**  
   - Integrated all prior tasks into a final code cell that demonstrated the cumulative use of `print()` and comments.

## Example Code from the Lab

Here is an example of a code snippet written during this lab:
```python
# Display introductory messages
print("Hello world!")
print("I am a security analyst.")
print("Python is useful for security!")
